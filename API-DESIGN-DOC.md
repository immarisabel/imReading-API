1. Introduction
   
   1.1 Purpose

   Ever since I begun to read I have been looking for ways to track my books. I have used journals, blogs and apps. Also social media. I never quite stuck anywhere until I begun writing updates on my GoodReads account. I realized what I've been missing. Appart from tracking books, something most apps can do nowadays, I wnat to log my experience.
My thoughts as I read, not after I finish. Yes, a final review is nice. But I enjoy the process, my reactions, my thoughts and ideas floating from the reflection of the page. I guess that is why I love the present tense of "I am", it means I am doing it on the moment. I did not read and forgot about it. I am reading it and savoring each moment.

   This app is an attempt to keep me present in the moment, present in just being, on the reading journey. Not wanting to just finish fast so I can rate and add another counted book to my list. My goal, to gather the experience of reading through a simple micro-blog dedicated to books.
